## Project Summary

This was a paired project that was designed to give teams a chance to walk through the entire lifecycle of a project brief: design, build, and client review/critique.

The first stage of the project required us to generate wireframes and a comp using Sketch. Below you will find a copy of the desktop and mobile comps that we submitted to another team:

## Inherited Comps

During the second phase of this project, we inherited a design challenge from another team to build out a static site. Those sketch comps are seen below:

The last phase of this project had the cohort come together to give group crituqes of both the designs and static sites. The static site for the design we inherited can be found below:

## Approach to the buildout

Our approach for this project was very collaborative. We thoroughly talked through how the build out would go (i.e. starting mobile first, break points, use of flexbox, etc.) and began the project by using the "ping-pong" method to split the workload. From there on out, we split up coding different sections on both the mobile and desktop versions. This gave both of us the opportunity to "touch" all areas of the comp. Since the Food Log and Challenges Sections for desktop were so different from mobile, we decided to build two versions for both desktop and mobile and toggle display: none in the media queries.
